Loan Eligibility Prediction

In the banking system, banks have a variety of products to provide, but credit lines are their primary source of revenue. As a result, they will profit from the interest earned on the loans they make. Loans, or whether customers repay or default on their loans, affect a bank's profit or loss. The bank's Non-Performing Assets will be reduced by forecasting loan defaulters. As a result, further investigation into this occurrence is essential. Because precise forecasts are essential for benefit maximisation, it's crucial to analyse and compare the various methodologies. The logistic regression model is an important predictive analytics tool for detecting loan defaulters.
